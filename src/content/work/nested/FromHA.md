### Background 
>What is From Home Academy?

From Home Academy is an innovative online English learning platform designed to bring quality language education directly to students in the comfort and convenience of their own homes. Established with the mission to make English learning accessible, flexible, and effective, the academy caters to a diverse range of learners—from beginners to advanced speakers—across different age groups and professional backgrounds.

### Web Page Purpouse

The webpage serves as the central hub where prospective students can explore course offerings, teaching methodologies, and flexible scheduling options. It highlights the academy’s unique approach that combines personalized instruction with interactive multimedia resources, live virtual classes, and real-time feedback from experienced teachers.

### Technical Approach

To provide the best possible experience for our users, the From Home Academy website is built using Astro, a modern web framework designed for speed and performance. Astro allows us to deliver fast-loading pages by generating mostly static content and loading only the necessary JavaScript — which means students can access our resources quickly, even on slower connections.

For styling, we use Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that enables us to create a clean, responsive, and visually appealing design efficiently. Tailwind’s modular approach helps keep the website lightweight while offering great flexibility to adapt the look and feel for different devices, ensuring a seamless experience whether you’re on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

Together, Astro and Tailwind allow From Home Academy to combine beautiful design with optimal performance, so learners can focus on what matters most—improving their English skills without distractions or delays.
